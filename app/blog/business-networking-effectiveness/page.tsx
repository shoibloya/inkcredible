                  the classic debate between old-school premium business cards

                  in ways traditional printed cards simply cannot. By linking
                  your CRM system, you can skip the tedious and pricey task of
                  entering data by hand, which typically costs each sales
                  professional between $700 and $1,050 a month. Still, premium
                  printed cards tend to attract better-quality leads. Even if
                  you are paying more per card, the payoff is often worth it.
